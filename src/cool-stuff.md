## Devs

- 🤖 [beepb00p](https://beepb00p.xyz/): One of craziest and coolest sites I have seen around. No spoilers. Must visit.
- [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/): I end up here so much from HN that I used to think it was actually multiple blogs with the same design. Great tech stuff.
- [AnderSource](https://andersource.dev/): Another little random dev blog. Some procgen stuff.

## Read
- [Making Useless Stuff](https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/makinguselessstuff.html): "There is nothing I find more liberating than to spend a Saturday afternoon coding on some toy project."

## Watch

## Beautiful Portfolios
