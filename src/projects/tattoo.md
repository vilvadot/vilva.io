This was my first try at making something kind of resembling of procedural generation.

It uses a series of ugly permutations to generate ideas for tattoo designs. I often like to draw but sometimes lack the inspiration of what to put on paper, thanks to this the biggest problem is not the lack of ideas anymore :P

You can get from pretty innocent stuff to some good old random crazy tattoos that will surely give your local tattoo studio a hard day
