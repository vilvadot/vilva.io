My next take on trying some procedural generation.

I had this idea for some time of having a virtual universe running inside a little server and checking it now and then to see how it kept going. I like to think of this as a virtual ant colony!

With some basic rules and even reusing some of my previous stuff (jay for markov chains!) I did this. Not efficient. Not pretty. Not elegant. But fun as hell to play with!

Right now it is not persisted, but I plan to do it soon™️.
