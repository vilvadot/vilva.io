This came as a result of spending way too much time in reddit/proceduralgeneration

I have always loved procedurally generated stuff, so I decided to dip my hands into it by building this little utility to generate text based on a Markov Chains algorithm. A little example generating text 'training' the chains with Kafka's Methamorphosis:

And another one generating Lord of the Ring names:
