SERPENTO is a multiplayer, massive and urban version of the ‘snake’. A reinterpretation of one of the most epic arcade games in digital culture, which escapes the autism of our devices to occupy the urban screen of Medialab-Prado and its plaza.

In contrast to the individual character of the traditional ‘snake’, SERPENTO is a game for many. In fact, the more, the better! Each person who enters the square will become a virtual replica of themselves. The analog winds of each individual on the physical plane will correspond to the virtual position of a new snake on the screen. Thus, one will be at the same time in the square and on the screen. The square then becomes the screen and the screen, the square.
