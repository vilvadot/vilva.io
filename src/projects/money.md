“When you buy something, you are not paying for it with money. You’re paying with the hours of life you had to spend earning that money.“ - José Mújica
Forever since hearing that I had this on my mind. I wanted to have this present when buying online, so making a browser extension was the perfect channel for it and a great exercise!.
