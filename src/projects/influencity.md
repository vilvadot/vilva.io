Influencity will always be my first major project. I founded it with 3 partners, each of us taking care of a specific area of the company: Business, Marketing, Technology, and Design/Image. We aimed to conquer the (then) young and practically non-existing influencer marketing market and professionalizing it along the way.

I started as the Chief Design Officer (chief of no one btw), and took care of the image of the company as well as all the UI and UX stuff for a solid couple of years. Helping now and then with frontend stuff. I grew with the company and started to take more responsibility on the tech side of things, to the point I decided to ditch my design position and go full throttle front end developer.

Finally, I ended on the managerial side of things, taking care of my amazing team as the project manager and product owner. We managed to grow the company into a pretty sustainable state and with a team of around 20 people. Eventually, I felt it was time for me to move on and work on different projects so I decided to leave after 5 years.

The funny thing of making something with a lack of resources is that you get to find creative solutions and step yourself in to fill in those missing roles. That is something I will forever remember and be grateful for my adventure building Influencity.
