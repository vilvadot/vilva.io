That thing you had inside of you for months and finally found the courage to tell. That truth you have to tell but know will probably hurt. That thing you want to speak up but might put your situation at risk. They suck so much. True.

But they are so difficult for a reason. You know something is not working and you are willing to put yourself at risk for a change. It's a sacrifice of current comfort for future improvement.

Every time you have one of those conversations you choose the harder path. And not only in this conversation is where important transformations or breakthroughs are born. Just the act itself of talking it will make it a tiny bit easier the next time.

Don't fear difficult conversations, embrace them!

_\*Also, keep not being a dick when talking to people you care about._
