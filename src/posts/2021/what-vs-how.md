While thinking about goals for the next year, I can't get off my head that in the past I have confused the **WHAT I was trying to accomplish** with the **HOW I was going to get there.**

For example, with ByteVitae, I started building it, without a clear understanding of **WHAT** I was trying to accomplish. In reality, **WHAT** I was trying to do was:

*   Learn how to build products on my own.

Building ByteVitae was  just a way to get there. But there could have been many complementary others:

*   Start working with a more experienced team
*   Find a mentor
*   Read the right stuff

With that goal in mind, it is no surprise that it didn't end up profitable. I just wasn't optimizing for profit, but for dev skills. For that, the WHAT should have been more along the lines:

*   Learn how to generate recurring  revenue with digital products.

This doesn't even imply building anything. It is all business goals So next time you venture into a new adventure, think hard about this:

Have a clear picture first of **WHAT** you want to accomplish, so that you can focus on **HOW** to get there.
