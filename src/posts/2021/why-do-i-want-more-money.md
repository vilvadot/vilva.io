Today reading alkonaut's [comment in this hackernews thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25769570) really resonated:

> I got my higher education for free. I expect to save nothing for my children or their education. I expect to have to put aside very little for retirement. The thing is, I just can’t find an argument why I should be able to get very rich doing my job. It’s a comfortable job. It pays a good salary. I got here by taking no risk at all.

Being a fellow European in a very comfortable position I can't avoid feeling the same. This has caused some internal friction, since I see that the drive behind most of my product/startup building efforts is chasing wealth. But, what for?

My current lifestyle is plenty covered by my salary, on a job that I quite enjoy, and I have enough extra to save for when things get ugly. So why seek more?

Buying more or expensive stuff doesn't make me happier anymore. Yeah, I could travel more, or buy that van I have been thinking off lately. But let's be honest, I don't need to build a successful product for that. And If I go that route, what is the cost?. Time?

I catch myself often trying to fool myself into believing that it is a matter of investing time once to earn profits for a lifetime, but if you know anything about the indie product building scene you know that this is far from true. It's a lie we tell ourselves to keep going: _"The next project will be the one. Just build it, sit back watching it grow and collect that sweet MRR"_.

If what is driving my desire to build new products, is money... perpetuating this cycle sounds kinda stupid:

> Spend free time to build stuff -> Earn money selling stuff -> Use money to buy free time.

It feels like chasing to increase the score, just to make the number grow, like in a video game. Driven by pure inertia. This is not a rant against capitalism or anything. But getting on practical terms, it starts to feel a bit absurd.

The hard truth I had to face recently is that the product that brought me the most joy got me exactly 0€ (actually it is costing me monthly). But I have seen its huge impact in the life of it's single user.

I'm trying to understand this because the great desire to build something big and succesful I had once has faded quite a bit. I lack the hunger anymore. And it all comes to the fact that chasing money feels empty at this point.

And yet I can't stop constantly thinking about new stuff to build and generate profit. Like a hamster running in it's little wheel.

Vilva.
