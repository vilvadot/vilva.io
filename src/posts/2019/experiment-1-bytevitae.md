The problem
-----------

A few years ago, when I was designing full time, a developer friend came to me asking for help with a job change. He was a great dev, but lacked any design skills, and needed some way to make a good looking Currículum. After seeing the result, a friend of his contacted me and offered money for me to do the same for him.

Fast forward to this year. I participated in a RUN with my mates at [Devscola](http://www.devscola.org/), and when it finished suddenly there where 20 people needing CVs to land their first job.

So the idea kept ringing in my head.

The goal
--------

A tool **for developers** to create and keep an up to date, great looking CV in a fast and easy way.
