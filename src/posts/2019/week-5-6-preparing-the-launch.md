![Week #5 & #6 - Preparing the launch!](/images/2019/07/launch2.jpg)

Hello my mysterious reader! As you can see, I have decided to change the cadence of these posts from weekly to **one post every two weeks**. Writing weekly has become harder every time and I feel like I'm forcing myself too much o keep up to the pace.

These weeks have been probably the most intense of all. With the core SaaS features done, **I have been focusing 100% on the value proposal**, create great looking CVs in an easy and fast way.

### TL;DR

*   Byte Vitae has gotten a **new logo**
*   The product is **100% working**
*   Users can now **add manual info** besides Github one
*   I have decided for a Freemium **business model**
*   Working on a **new kickass UI**

The stats

Again, 0 marketing done and 0 improvement

I got a visit from my family so I took a little "vacation" there

### 📰 Blog updated

First of all, I took some time this week to update this blog and theme to the latest Ghost version. I wasn't aware that **I was several major versions out of date**. This improved the admin panel and fixed a few bugs (like the RSS feed) which should now be working.

### 🎨 Logo (~40€)

Making logos is one of those things that completely suck the energy our of me. Not sure why, but having a pending task titled: 'Design Logo' completely fucks with my mind (probably PSTD from the freelance days). **So I decided to spend the coin and hire someone to make a logo for me**.  I went to People Per Hour and found a designer I liked. I sent [Zubair](https://www.peopleperhour.com/hourlie/design-logo-with-3-initial-concepts-including-all-quality-work/495098) the idea I had in mind and he sent me 3 proposals in 48h, one of which I really liked.

psst... it's the first one

To be honest, **I think I'm always going to order logos from now on**, the price was so low and the quality good enough that I think it's way better to invest that time in other stuff.

### 🔥 The first CV!

At last! Milestone achieved, I have been after this for sooo long now. The product is fully functional and the proof of it is:

The first Currículum Vitae 100% generated with ByteVitae. Fuck yeah! 🤟🏻  
**Now it's all a matter of tweaking things, improving the design and gathering feedback to fine tune the templates and info to real user's needs**. But I will have to wait until the launch for that.

### 📝 Add manual info

With all the infofmation obtained from Github, I still need a way to include some other stuff like education, experience or contact data that Github doesn't provide. In the future (**very close future ;)** ), this will be automated, but for now, the user must add it manually. Only once and available forever.

Right now it's a messy form, but **it proved that even with this shitty form the process was pretty fast and comfortable**. Way better than designing it by hand. So I can't wait to test it with the new UI!

A user CV can now have Personal info, contact data, social media/links, repo information, skills, education, and past experience. Not bad!

### 🌈 UI

With all the core stuff done what is missing is a kickass UI. I think it could be one of the biggest selling points of the product so I invested some time giving it love. It might change a bit but this is the direction I'm going towards:

### 💰The business model

I have been thinking about this for quite some time, how am I going to charge for using the product? At the end I have settled on a freemium model:

If you decide to use it free you can generate as much CVs with the simple template as you want but **they will come with a little non-intrusive link watermarked in each page**. This means that at least for using it for free you are helping spread the word. I expect this will work for a lot of users.

**If you upgrade to PRO you remove the watermark and you get access to all templates** that will be included and possibly other goodies as the product grows.

I'm happy with the model, but I will have to wait and iterate as I get feedback on its results.

### 🚀 Launch

The biggest thing this week... I'm launching! The product is fully working at this stage, once I give a polish to the UI I'm going to launch it in stages to test things out and get some feedback. My planned launch is as follows:

*   **Private BETA**: This week, friends, family, and Typeform emails. Basically, people close to me who I can get tasty feedback to improve the product before the final release.
*   **Public BETA**: Next week, to indiehackers.com. Here I expect minimal traffic but good feedback, which will prepare me for the final release.
*   **Final Launch**: Once polished 100%. Hackernews, ProductHunt and maybe Reddit (not very used to the last one). The scary stuff 😱. One single shot for this, so that's why I'm polishing the product so much. I believe the product offers great value, so I rather not fuck it up with a bad UI or bugs. I might also have to prepare server-wise for this since I've heard a good launch can easily take down servers.

### Next Steps

So right now I'm working on implementing the UI I designed and preparing everything for the launch, which means:

*   **Make sure the payment flow works as expected**
*   **Create a new landing page**
*   **Get at least 5 more CV templates done**
*   **Launch, gather feedback and improve FAST**
*   **Prepare product hunt graphics and release**
